# Baseline
The goal of the 2 python programs is to establish what kind of baseline results we can get to create.

## baseline model.py
In this file is a linear regression and decision tree made. 
* All of the country spectral data is being obtained and the corresponding OC values for each sample (obtain_data())
* Outliers are removed (remove_outliers())
* Data is being splitted in train- and testset (split_data())
* Linear regression and decision tree model is made (linear_regression_model(), decision_tree_model())


## regression model.py
This file contains multiple regression models. Linear, Decision Tree and Random forest regression
* All of the country spectral data is being obtained and the corresponding OC values for each sample
* Outliers are removed
* Data is being splitted in train- and testset
* Models linear, decision tree and random forest regression are made
